#### Homework (~20 min) [6b]
##### Implement tidyverse example into shiny and commit into your forked repository

* Prepare interactive scatterplot (Premium vs. Expenses) we have seen in [`ggplot2` example](Support/About_tidyverse_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png) and make __colouring__ of the scatter points dynamic based on not only `Region`, but for all categorical variable available in data set `dt_KPI`. Use `shiny` framework
* Save your application into `Lessons/Lesson3/Homework` and `commit` it to your forked repository

> Hint: instead of `aes` you might need `aes_string` 

It might look something like this:
